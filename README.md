# ft_ls:

The ls command is one of the first commands you have learned to use with shell. It is
also one you are using the most. Perhaps you have already asked yourself how is this
function coded? Thanks to this project, you will soon find out.
To Recode ls and some of its options will allow you to find out how to interact with
the file system using C. After all, you already know how to open, read, write and close a
file. But, what about the directories? Special files? Rights, dates or sizes of the files?
